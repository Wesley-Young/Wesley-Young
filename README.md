# Hi there!

My name is Wesley F. Young, an undergraduate student majoring in [Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I was once an addicted Minecraft player, but I am fading out because of increasing pressure from my major. However, I am still concerned about Minecraft developers community and willing to lend a helping hand.

## My projects

Here are some projects I am currently working on:
- [**bedrock-stdhub**](https://github.com/bedrock-stdhub), a plugin loader for unmodified Bedrock Dedicated Server, in response to Microsoft's stopping offering PDB files for BDS.
- [**projectGDT**](https://github.com/projectGDT), an identity system based on Minecraft accounts (both Java and Bedrock), for a more connected Minecraft world. **Delayed.**
- [**NapCatQQ**](https://github.com/NapNeko/NapCatQQ), an epoch-making (however not completely opensource) QQ Bot framework.

I am also working in [Student Association of Science and Technology, Dept. Phys.](https://github.com/dpsast) (abbr. DPSAST) of Tsinghua University. My work is maintaining the server of the association and developing new features, and I also have some projects for DPSAST.

## A little more about me? Sure!

- The anime character in my avatar is Cecilia from comic & TV anime [_Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence_](https://shiroseijyo-anime.com/). 
- The first programming language I learned is Visual Basic. 
- I am convinced that JavaScript (TypeScript / ECMAScript) is a 'full-stack' language, which can power both frontend and backend.
